    'desc'=>'While there are concerns over Thailand’s bourgeoning ageing population, with the topic popping up now and then in the media,
    the issue hasn’t been discussed as seriously as it is in countries such as Japan or China, until recently. However,
    according to the National Statistic of Thailand (NSO), two years from now the ageing population in Thailand is calculated to be around 20% of the total
    population and by the time we reach 2031 that ratio is forecasted to increase to over 28%. By then, our country will be in the same situation as Japan is in today,
    a super aged society. That means twelve years from now the country will face economic stagnation, a decrease in its workforce, and,
    of course, an increase in health care and welfare demands.',
